// 1. Tell me something about your self
// Hello, my name is Harish Parashar,
// I have completed my Bachelor's (BCA) and Masterâ€™s (MCA) in Computer Applications.
// I have more than 5 years of experience as a Frontend Developer.
// I have strong hands-on experience with React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, 
// and UI tools like Tailwind CSS, MUI, Ant Design, and Bootstrap.
// Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects across domains like EdTech, 
// E-commerce, Social Monetization, InsurTech, LegalTech, and Logistics.
// I have been responsible for designing responsive UIs, integrating APIs, and optimizing performance and deliver task on time.
// I work in agile enviourment where i actively participate in sprint planning,code reviews and deployement.
// I enjoy learning new tools, improving performance, and working with teams to deliver quality products.
    
// My project approach starts with understanding the requirements.
// I plan a clean and scalable project structure and follow a component-based approach.
// I create reusable components to keep the code simple, clean, and consistent.

// 2. what is your role and responsibility in last company.
// In my last company, I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer. I handled both development and some team leadership responsibilities. 
// I led a team of 5â€“6 frontend developers, planned tasks, did code reviews, and ensured the team followed clean coding practices. 
// I also mentored new joiners, 
// helping them understand the project structure, React concepts, and coding standards.

// digip project 
// I worked on a project called Digip Marketplace, which is an online platform that connects clients with lawyers. 
// It supports three roles: Client, Lawyer, and Admin. 
// The main goal of the platform is to simplify the legal hiring process by providing a digital interface 
// where clients can find and communicate with legal professionals easily.
// I personally designed and developed over 50 responsive UI screens using React, MUI, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
// I implemented role-based features:
// Clients can search for and hire lawyers.
// Lawyers can manage cases, update their availability, and chat with clients.
// Admins have control over both user types and can manage onboarding, deactivation, and role permissions.
// For testing, we used Jest, React Testing Library, and Enzyme to cover UI behavior and edge cases.
// We followed Agile methodology, participated in sprint planning, and used tools like sonarQUbe . 
// I regularly worked with designers, back-end developers, and QA to ship features on time.


//  What challenges have you faced in your project, and how did you resolve them?
// One of the key challenges I faced in a recent project was upgrading React from version 16.8 to 18.2 in a large-scale production application.

// ðŸ”¹ Challenges:
// Several class components used deprecated lifecycle methods like componentWillReceiveProps, which broke in the newer version.
// Some third-party libraries were not compatible with React 18 and caused unexpected issues.
// Enabling StrictMode surfaced hidden bugs due to double-invoked lifecycle methods in development.
// New features like automatic batching and concurrent rendering changed how state updates worked, leading to subtle UI bugs.

// ðŸ”§ How I resolved it:
// I audited the codebase and listed all affected areas.
// Refactored class components into functional components using hooks.
// Updated or replaced incompatible third-party packages.
// Performed thorough testing in the staging environment before going live.
// Used feature flags to gradually roll out sensitive updates.
// Documented all changes and conducted sessions with the team to ensure smooth adoption.
