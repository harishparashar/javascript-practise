// digip project 
// I worked on a project called Digip Marketplace, which is an online platform that connects clients with lawyers. 
// It supports three roles: Client, Lawyer, and Admin. 
// The main goal of the platform is to simplify the legal hiring process by providing a digital interface 
// where clients can find and communicate with legal professionals easily.
// I personally designed and developed over 50 responsive UI screens using React, MUI, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
// I implemented role-based features:
// Clients can search for and hire lawyers.
// Lawyers can manage cases, update their availability, and chat with clients.
// Admins have control over both user types and can manage onboarding, deactivation, and role permissions.
// For testing, we used Jest, React Testing Library, and Enzyme to cover UI behavior and edge cases.
// We followed Agile methodology, participated in sprint planning, and used tools like sonarQUbe . 
// I regularly worked with designers, back-end developers, and QA to ship features on time.
